        <p class="prose">
            I am a 90s kid! I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the early 1990s into a loving and supportive family. I grew up enjoying science, 
                cross country, video games, music, and language. <a href="https://www.sonataarctica.info/audio/ecliptica/"><i>FullMoon</i></a> by Finnish metal band 
                <a href="https://www.sonataarctica.info/">Sonata Arctica</a> is the song that convinced me to pick up the guitar. I used to day dream about dropping out of high school 
                and being in a heavy metal band. (Most days I am glad that this is not what I actually did!) I skipped math homework for two weeks to play 
                <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/index.html"><i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i></a>.
                I went to college as a biochemistry major
                thinking about maybe being a doctor or going to graduate school. Ultimately I opted for grad school to study organic chemistry. I graduated with my master's degree 
                in 2018 and at the recommendation of a friend I actually ended up applying for a job in corporate client services with proxy advisory firm
                <a href="https://issgovernance.com">Institutional Shareholder Services</a>, where I ended up working for nearly 3.5 years. 
                Throughout my life I have tried to expose myself to foreign 
                and ancient languages, including Spanish, Czech, Chinese, Greek, and Latin. I play several video games in Spanish, a couple of my favorites being 
                <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim10">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.sekirothegame.com/home">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>.
                Philosophy did not originally appeal to me, but during graduate school I became more interested in it, particularly in 
                <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/">metaphysics</a>.
                Today, I am learning coding and programming at <a href="https://codingtemple.com/">Coding Temple</a> and hope to become a software and web developer.
