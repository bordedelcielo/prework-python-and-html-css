        <td class="text_orange">I am interested in language! My parents bought me a copy of Rosetta Stone Spanish 
          when I was in high school annd I really enjoyed the immersive approach to language. I traveled to China
          and picked up a bit of Chinese, but my undergrad institution did not offer Chinese courses, so I took French
          for modern language. For some reason, the French noun I remember most vividly is "poisson" ("fish").
          These days I am interested in classical languages, including Latin and Greek. (Salve amicus!) I also continue to study Spanish,
          and choose to play several video games in Spanish. (Te gusta los juegos!) </td>

        <td class="text_dark">When I was a kid, I was very interested in reading about animals and dinosaurs. 
          My interest in science definitely began with zoology and paleontology. I decided to major in science
          for college and graduate school and am really glad that I did. However, I came to the conclusion during
          my scientific studies that philosophy forms the necessary backdrop to science, without which science
          itself cannot flourish. In particular, I like to read about metaphysics and philosophy of mind in my spare time.</td>
